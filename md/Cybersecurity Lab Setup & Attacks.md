Hi everyone,

and welcome to the cybersecurity lab environment and EVE-NG. Basically, this course is designed for anyone, whether you have experience or not in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, bug bounty, or whatever. This course will help you to develop and set up a lab environment inside EVE-NG. We are going to convert different types of images to QCOW2 so that we can use them inside our lab.

There are four top vulnerable servers: we have OWASP Broken Web Application, Buggy Web Application, PHP Action Web Application, and Metasploitable 2 Web Application. We will test a lot of things such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and all these things on these four servers. Besides, we have one Linux web server and another Windows web server, and we have a few clients to test them. Also, we have DHCP and DNS and everything inside this lab.

So in this lab, besides setting up a lab, our next target is to perform different cyber attacks. The first 20 cyber attacks we will perform include reconnaissance attack, MAC flooding attack, ping of death attack, ICMP flooding attack, SYN flooding attack, smurf attack, LAN attack, slowloris attack, ARP spoofing, DHCP starvation, DHCP spoofing attack, password attack, phishing attack, SQL injection, DNS attack, and many other attacks we will perform in this lab.

There is some basic stuff as well, such as an introduction to cybersecurity, defense models of cybersecurity, the importance of cybersecurity, models of cybersecurity, cybersecurity certifications, zero trust architecture, layers of the web, best operating systems for hacking, and best hardware for hacking. We will cover OWASP Top 10 and vulnerable web applications, and then we will create a lab environment, how to install EVE-NG, how to install VMware, how to install the client pack, how to convert QCOW images, and how to upload routers and switches.

The main thing is how to create these vulnerable servers such as Buggy Web Application, Metasploitable, OWASP Top 10, Broken Web Application, PHP Action, and then we will install the top four attacker systems such as Kali Linux, BackBox, Parrot OS, and after that, we will perform all these labs. This course will help you to build a lab inside your EVE-NG and also how to perform various tasks. It will help you to take a path whether you want to go into ethical hacking, penetration testing, or cybersecurity. So it will help you on all these paths. Thank you very much.

Hi everyone, and welcome to the cybersecurity lab environment and EVE-NG. This course is designed for anyone, regardless of experience in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, bug bounties, or related fields. This course will help you develop and set up a lab environment inside EVE-NG. We'll convert different image types to QCOW2 for use in our lab. The lab will include four top vulnerable servers: the OWASP Broken Web Application, a buggy web application, a PHP action web application, and the Metasploitable web application. We will test vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting on these servers. In addition, there will be one Linux web server, another Windows web server, and several clients for testing. The lab will also include DHCP and DNS. The primary focus is performing various cyber attacks. The first 20 cyber attacks will include reconnaissance attacks, MAC flooding attacks, ping update attacks, ICMP flooding attacks, SYN flooding attacks, smurf attacks, LAN attacks, Slowloris attacks, ARP spoofing, DHCP starvation, DHCP spoofing attacks, password attacks, phishing attacks, SQL injection, DNS attacks, and many others. Additionally, the course covers basic topics such as an introduction to cybersecurity, defense models, the importance of cybersecurity, models of cybersecurity, certifications in cybersecurity, zero-trust architecture, layers of the web, best operating systems for hacking, best hacking hardware, and OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. The course will also cover how to install EVE-NG, VMware, client packs, how to convert QCOW images, and how to upload routers and switches. The main focus is on creating vulnerable servers like the buggy web application, Metasploitable, OWASP top 10, and the broken web application PHP action. Then, we will install attacker systems such as Kali Linux, BackBox, Parrot operating system, and perform the lab exercises. This course will help you build a lab inside EVE-NG and teach you how to perform various cyber activities. It will guide you toward ethical hacking, penetration testing, or cybersecurity.
